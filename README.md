# bool_question_answering
BoolQ to deal with complex and confusing text. Web app using Streamlit.

NLP problems such as the ones which deal with very complex and confusing statements where identifying subject is very difficult.
Statements like:

```
It is x, no no it is y. I am confused between x and y but i will finally go with z at the end.
```

For NLP, it is very difficult to recognize the final subject, "z" in this case.

BoolQ is answer to such problem statements.

Streamlit is used to create a web app. It is basically used as python library.

To invoke:
```
streamlit run streamlit_web_app.py
```
